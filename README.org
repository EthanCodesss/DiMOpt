#+TITLE: DiMOpt: A Distributed Multi-robot Trajectory Optimization algorithm


* Introduction
** Implemented Method Overview
This software implements a *Distributed Multi-robot  trajectory Optimization Algorithm* (DiMOpt) that deals with the problem of computing trajectories for multiple robots navigating in a shared space. This method exploits:
1. /Consensus optimization strategies/ to tackle collision constrains that couple robot's decision variables,
2. Single-robot /sequential convex programming/ (SCP) method for efficiently handling non-convexities introduced by dynamics.
** Simple Example
Trajectories computed at each iteration of the DiMOpt algorithm for a fleet of five robots.
