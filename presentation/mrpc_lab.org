*** Overall
*Problem*
1. RobotsTr
   a) complex dynamics (/F/) ðŸ’€
   b) geometric shapes
2. Minimize cost (/f_0/)
3. Start and end configuration (/x_start/ , /x_goal/)
4. No collision environment (/H/)
5. No collision between robots (/C/) ðŸ’€
*Solution*
- Control sequence (/u/)

* Why is this Difficult!
1. Complex dynamics (/F/) ðŸ’€
2. No collision between robots (/C/) ðŸ’€
* Why is this Difficult!
1. Complex dynamics (/F/) ðŸ’€
   - Compute KKT conditions (optimality) - not trivial *[Optimizie* âž¡ *Discretize]*
   *OR*
   - Transcription from continuous to discrete time into NLP *[Discretize* âž¡ Opitmize]

   *Both*  are Non-convex [Pfaffian constraints]

   - Couples robots's decision variables
* How to address this issues?
** Complex dynamics
Sequential Convex Programming
- short summary: iteratively convexify and optimize
- convexify dynamics (/f_r/) and collisions (/c_ij/)
- L1 penalti cost function:
